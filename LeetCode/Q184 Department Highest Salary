Create table Department (Id int, Name varchar(255))

--Method 1
select d.Name as Department, e.Name as Employee, e.Salary
from Employee e left join Department d
on e.DepartmentId = d.Id
inner join

	from Employee
	group by DepartmentId
) sub
on e.DepartmentId = sub.DepartmentId and e.Salary = sub.Salary
where d.Name is not null
order by d.Name, e.Name

--Method 2: with CTE
